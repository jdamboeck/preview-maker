# Workflow Test

This file was created using MCP functions to test the workflow pipeline as documented.

## Steps Tested

1. Branch creation with `mcp_github_create_branch`
2. File creation with `mcp_github_push_files`
3. Pull request creation with `mcp_github_create_pull_request`

This verifies our documented workflow functions correctly.
