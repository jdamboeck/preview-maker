Please analyze this image and identify ONE SPECIFIC {target_type} that stands out.

I need you to find a SINGLE, DISTINCT object or feature in this image - not a general area.

Step by step:
1. Scan the entire image for distinct {target_type} elements
2. Identify ONE specific element that is:
   - Clearly defined with distinct boundaries
   - Visually separate from its surroundings
   - Small enough to be a precise target (5-15% of the image area)
   - Detailed enough to benefit from magnification

3. Find the exact center point of this specific element
4. Create a tight bounding box directly around ONLY this single element

Respond with TWO PARTS:

1. COORDS: Normalized values between 0 and 1 in the format x1,y1,x2,y2 where (x1,y1) is the top-left corner and (x2,y2) is the bottom-right corner.

2. DESCRIPTION: A brief description (1-2 sentences) of what you identified and why it's interesting or visually notable.

Format your response EXACTLY as:
COORDS: x1,y1,x2,y2
DESCRIPTION: Your description here.
