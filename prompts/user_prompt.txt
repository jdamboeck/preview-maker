Please analyze this image and identify ONE SPECIFIC {target_type} that stands out.

I need you to find a SINGLE, DISTINCT object or feature in this image - not a general area.

Step by step:
1. Scan the entire image for distinct {target_type} elements
2. Identify ONE specific element that is:
   - Clearly defined with distinct boundaries
   - Visually separate from its surroundings
   - Small enough to be a precise target (5-15% of the image area)
   - Detailed enough to benefit from magnification

3. Find the exact center point of this specific element
4. Create a tight bounding box directly around ONLY this single element
