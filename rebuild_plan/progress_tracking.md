   - Create ConfigManager class with singleton pattern
   - Add _reset_for_testing method for test isolation
   - Implement configuration loading from file and environment

2. **Update Logging System**
   - Fix setup_logging to accept log_level parameter
   - Ensure all logging tests pass

3. **Fix UI Test Mocks**
   - Update mock implementation for GTK Application tests
   - Ensure UI tests can run in headless mode

4. **Address Linter Errors**
   - Add type hints for GTK and Cairo
   - Fix remaining linter errors in the codebase
