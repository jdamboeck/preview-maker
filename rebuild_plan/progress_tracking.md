| Cairo Integration     | Linter errors for Cairo types | Fix import issues and add proper type hints               | To Be Addressed |

## Next Steps

Based on our current progress, the following tasks should be prioritized:

1. **Address Linter Errors**

   - Add type hints for GTK and Cairo
   - Fix remaining linter errors in the codebase

2. **Implement Analysis Results Display**

   - Create UI for displaying Gemini AI analysis results
   - Add formatting and layout components

3. **Integrate with Gemini API**

   - Finalize Gemini integration for image analysis
   - Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

4. **Complete UI Components**
   - Implement remaining UI components (Preview Panel, Export Dialog, Batch Processor)
   - Ensure consistent styling and behavior across all components

## Notes

- The implementation sequence is defined in rebuild_plan/06_implementation_strategy/01_implementation_sequence.md
- Current focus areas:
  1. Fix UI tests for GTK 4.0 compatibility
  2. Implement missing methods in ManualOverlayManager
  3. Fix OverlayControlPanel UI element issues
  4. Continue with remaining UI components
- Docker environment is operational for development and testing
