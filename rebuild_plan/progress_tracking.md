## Issues and Blockers

| Issue | Impact | Resolution Plan | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GTK 4.0 Compatibility | UI tests failing | Update test code to use GTK 4.0 event processing approach | In Progress |
| ManualOverlayManager missing methods | 7 of 8 Overlay Controls tests failing | Implement `get_overlay_count()` method | To Be Addressed |
| Delete Overlay button not found | UI test failures | Fix OverlayControlPanel UI structure | To Be Addressed |
| Parameter mismatch in create_overlay_at() | Tests failing | Fix method signature | To Be Addressed |
| GTK 4.0 Type Hints | Linter errors for GTK types | Add stub files or type comments | To Be Addressed |
| Cairo Integration | Linter errors for Cairo types | Fix import issues and add proper type hints | To Be Addressed |

## Next Steps

Based on our current progress, the following tasks should be prioritized:

1. **Fix GTK 4.0 Compatibility Issues**
   - Replace Gtk.events_pending() with appropriate GTK 4.0 event processing code
   - Update deprecated GTK 4.0 API usage (CssProvider.load_from_data, Widget.get_style_context, etc.)

2. **Implement Missing Methods in ManualOverlayManager**
   - Add get_overlay_count() method
   - Fix create_overlay_at() parameter handling

3. **Fix OverlayControlPanel UI Structure**
   - Ensure Delete Overlay button is correctly created and accessible
   - Fix color selection functionality

4. **Address Linter Errors**
   - Add type hints for GTK and Cairo
   - Fix remaining linter errors in the codebase

## Notes

- The implementation sequence is defined in rebuild_plan/06_implementation_strategy/01_implementation_sequence.md
- Current focus areas:
  1. Fix UI tests for GTK 4.0 compatibility
  2. Implement missing methods in ManualOverlayManager
  3. Fix OverlayControlPanel UI element issues
  4. Continue with remaining UI components
- Docker environment is operational for development and testing
