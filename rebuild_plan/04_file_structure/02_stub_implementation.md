# Phase 4.2: Create Stub Implementation with Type Hints

## Overview
This phase populates the empty files created in the previous phase with properly typed stub implementations. These stubs define the interfaces, type annotations, and docstrings but defer the actual implementation. This creates a structural foundation that can be incrementally filled with real implementations.

## Goals
- Add function and class stubs with type annotations to all files
- Implement imports and module structure
- Add detailed docstrings to all stubs
- Set up basic error types and enums

## Tasks

### Task 4.2.1: Create Core Module Stubs
- [ ] Implement configuration module stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/config/settings.py
  # app/config/defaults.py
  # app/config/migration.py
  ```
- [ ] Add analyzer module stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/core/analyzer.py
  ```
- [ ] Create AI service stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/core/ai_service.py
  ```
- [ ] Implement processor module stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/core/processor.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: All core modules have typed stubs with proper interfaces and docstrings

### Task 4.2.2: Create UI Module Stubs
- [ ] Implement main window stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/ui/app_window.py
  ```
- [ ] Add component stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/ui/components/drop_zone.py
  # app/ui/components/preview_panel.py
  # app/ui/components/settings_panel.py
  # app/ui/components/notification.py
  ```
- [ ] Create dialog stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/ui/dialogs/settings_dialog.py
  # app/ui/dialogs/manual_mode_dialog.py
  # app/ui/dialogs/about_dialog.py
  # app/ui/dialogs/error_dialog.py
  ```
- [ ] Implement handler stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/ui/handlers/drop_handler.py
  # app/ui/handlers/click_handler.py
  # app/ui/handlers/keyboard_handler.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: All UI modules have typed stubs with proper interfaces and docstrings

### Task 4.2.3: Create Utility Module Stubs
- [ ] Implement file utility stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/utils/file_utils.py
  ```
- [ ] Add image utility stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/utils/image_utils.py
  ```
- [ ] Create threading utility stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/utils/threading.py
  ```
- [ ] Implement logging utility stubs
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/utils/logging.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: All utility modules have typed stubs with proper interfaces and docstrings

### Task 4.2.4: Create Package Exports and Error Types
- [ ] Set up package exports in `__init__.py` files
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/__init__.py
  # app/config/__init__.py
  # app/core/__init__.py
  # app/ui/__init__.py
  # app/ui/components/__init__.py
  # app/ui/dialogs/__init__.py
  # app/ui/handlers/__init__.py
  # app/utils/__init__.py
  ```
- [ ] Define error hierarchy
  ```bash
  # Create new file:
  touch app/exceptions.py
  ```
- [ ] Create enum types
  ```bash
  # Create new file:
  touch app/constants.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Proper package structure with exports, complete error hierarchy, and enum definitions

### Task 4.2.5: Create Application Entry Point
- [ ] Implement main.py with application entry point
  ```bash
  # Files to update:
  # app/main.py
  ```
- [ ] Create command-line interface structure
  ```bash
  # Create new file:
  touch app/cli.py
  ```
- [ ] Set up application initialization
  ```bash
  # Update with initialization code:
  # app/__init__.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Working application entry point that initializes the component structure

## AI Entry Point
When entering at this step, you should:

1. First examine the existing code to understand component interfaces
   - Study the current implementation in preview_maker.py
   - Note the interfaces between existing components
   - Understand current type usage and function signatures
2. Implement the core module stubs as in Task 4.2.1
   - Create proper type annotations for all functions and classes
   - Write comprehensive docstrings with parameter descriptions
   - Define interfaces but leave implementation as `pass` statements
3. Create the UI module stubs as in Task 4.2.2
   - Define GTK component interfaces
   - Document UI component interfaces and parameters
   - Create signal/event definitions
4. Implement utility module stubs as in Task 4.2.3
   - Define utility function signatures with types
   - Document parameters and return values
5. Set up package exports and error types as in Task 4.2.4
   - Create consistent error hierarchy
   - Define proper imports and exports
6. Create the application entry point as in Task 4.2.5
   - Set up initialization sequence
   - Define command-line interface
7. Verify all success criteria are met
