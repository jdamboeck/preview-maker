# Phase 5.2: Develop Agent Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This phase creates comprehensive workflow documentation that guides AI agents through common development tasks in the codebase. The documentation provides step-by-step processes, examples, and troubleshooting guidance to maximize AI productivity in the rebuild process.

## Goals
- Create documentation for common agent workflows
- Develop task-specific guidance
- Provide example implementations for reference
- Create a Q&A section for common issues

## Tasks

### Task 5.2.1: Document Core Development Workflows
- [ ] Create new component implementation workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/implementing_new_component.md
  ```
- [ ] Define bug fixing workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/fixing_bugs.md
  ```
- [ ] Document feature enhancement workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/enhancing_features.md
  ```
- [ ] Establish refactoring workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/refactoring_code.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Clear workflow documentation for all core development tasks

### Task 5.2.2: Create Component-Specific Workflows
- [ ] Document UI component development workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/ui_component_development.md
  ```
- [ ] Define core module implementation workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/core_module_implementation.md
  ```
- [ ] Create configuration workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/configuration_management.md
  ```
- [ ] Establish testing workflow
  ```bash
  touch docs/workflows/testing_components.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Component-specific workflow guides with detailed steps

### Task 5.2.3: Create Task Example Library
- [ ] Implement UI component example
  ```bash
  touch docs/examples/ui_component_example.py
  ```
- [ ] Create core module example
  ```bash
  touch docs/examples/core_module_example.py
  ```
- [ ] Define utility function example
  ```bash
  touch docs/examples/utility_example.py
  ```
- [ ] Establish test implementation example
  ```bash
  touch docs/examples/test_example.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Clear, well-documented examples for each component type

### Task 5.2.4: Create Agent Troubleshooting Guide
- [ ] Document common coding issues
  ```bash
  touch docs/troubleshooting/common_coding_issues.md
  ```
- [ ] Define type annotation problems and solutions
  ```bash
  touch docs/troubleshooting/type_annotation_issues.md
  ```
- [ ] Create GTK-specific troubleshooting
  ```bash
  touch docs/troubleshooting/gtk_issues.md
  ```
- [ ] Establish dependency issues guide
  ```bash
  touch docs/troubleshooting/dependency_issues.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for common issues

### Task 5.2.5: Create AI Agent Q&A Document
- [ ] Create frequently asked questions document
  ```bash
  touch docs/ai/faq.md
  ```
- [ ] Document common misunderstandings
  ```bash
  touch docs/ai/common_misunderstandings.md
  ```
- [ ] Create architectural decisions explanation
  ```bash
  touch docs/ai/architectural_decisions.md
  ```
- [ ] Establish component relationship explanations
  ```bash
  touch docs/ai/component_relationships.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive Q&A documentation that addresses common questions and misunderstandings

## AI Entry Point
When entering at this step, you should:

1. First review the AI assistant templates from Phase 5.1
2. Examine the component specifications from Phase 3
3. Document the core development workflows as in Task 5.2.1
   - Create clear step-by-step guides
   - Include decision points and considerations
   - Provide examples of workflow completion
4. Create component-specific workflows as in Task 5.2.2
   - Detail the unique aspects of each component type
   - Document interactions with other components
   - Include guidance on testing and validation
5. Develop the task example library as in Task 5.2.3
   - Create clear, well-documented examples
   - Follow all coding standards and patterns
   - Include comments explaining key decisions
6. Create the agent troubleshooting guide as in Task 5.2.4
   - Document common issues and solutions
   - Provide debugging strategies
   - Include examples of problematic code and fixes
7. Develop the AI agent Q&A document as in Task 5.2.5
   - Answer common questions about the architecture
   - Clarify potential misunderstandings
   - Explain design decisions and tradeoffs
8. Verify all success criteria are met
9. Proceed to Phase 6.1: Create Incremental Implementation Plan

## Next Steps
Once this phase is complete, proceed to [Create Incremental Implementation Plan](../06_implementation_strategy/01_implementation_sequence.md)
