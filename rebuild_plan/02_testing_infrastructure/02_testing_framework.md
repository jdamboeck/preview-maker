# Phase 2.2: Testing Framework Setup

## Overview
This phase establishes a comprehensive testing framework that supports all aspects of the application. The framework will enable automated testing across different environments, with and without AI services, and provide tools for UI testing.

## Goals
- Set up pytest infrastructure with fixtures
- Create test runners for different scenarios
- Implement CI-compatible test configuration
- Develop image fixture library for testing

## Tasks

### Task 2.2.1: Set Up Basic Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Create pytest configuration
  ```bash
  touch pytest.ini
  touch tests/conftest.py
  ```
- [ ] Set up directory structure for different test types
  ```bash
  mkdir -p tests/unit/config tests/unit/core tests/unit/ui tests/unit/utils
  mkdir -p tests/integration/ui tests/integration/workflow
  mkdir -p tests/fixtures/images
  ```
- [ ] Configure test environment variables
- [ ] Add test requirements to requirements.txt

**Success Criteria**: Basic pytest setup that can run simple tests

### Task 2.2.2: Create Core Test Fixtures
- [ ] Create image fixture loader
  ```bash
  touch tests/fixtures/fixture_loader.py
  ```
- [ ] Add configuration fixtures
  ```bash
  touch tests/fixtures/config_fixtures.py
  ```
- [ ] Create mock AI service fixtures
  ```bash
  touch tests/fixtures/ai_fixtures.py
  ```
- [ ] Implement filesystem fixtures for testing file operations
  ```bash
  touch tests/fixtures/fs_fixtures.py
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Working fixtures that can be used in multiple test scenarios

### Task 2.2.3: Implement Test Image Library
- [ ] Create categorized test images
  ```bash
  mkdir -p tests/fixtures/images/{products,landscapes,textures,people,fails}
  ```
- [ ] Document expected detection results for each image
  ```bash
  touch tests/fixtures/images/expected_results.json
  ```
- [ ] Add utility to generate test images with known characteristics
  ```bash
  touch tools/generate_test_images.py
  ```
- [ ] Create corrupt/invalid images for testing error handling

**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive set of test images with documented expected results

### Task 2.2.4: Set Up UI Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create GTK test harness
  ```bash
  touch tests/ui/gtk_test_harness.py
  ```
- [ ] Implement UI event simulation
  ```bash
  touch tests/ui/ui_event_simulator.py
  ```
- [ ] Add screenshot comparison utilities
  ```bash
  touch tests/ui/screenshot_comparator.py
  ```
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing

**Success Criteria**: Working UI test harness that can simulate user interactions

### Task 2.2.5: Create CI Test Configuration
- [ ] Set up CI configuration file
  ```bash
  touch .github/workflows/tests.yml
  ```
- [ ] Create test environment configuration
  ```bash
  touch tests/environments/ci_environment.py
  ```
- [ ] Configure headless UI testing
- [ ] Add test result reporting

**Success Criteria**: CI configuration that can run all tests in a headless environment

## AI Entry Point
When entering at this step, you should:

1. Examine any existing testing in the current codebase
2. Review the mock AI service from Phase 2.1
3. Set up the basic test infrastructure as in Task 2.2.1
   - Configure pytest to work with the project structure
   - Set up appropriate test discovery rules
4. Create the core test fixtures as in Task 2.2.2
   - Ensure fixtures handle AI service mocking
   - Create fixtures for common test scenarios
5. Implement the test image library as in Task 2.2.3
   - Ensure images cover a variety of test cases
   - Document expected detection results for verification
6. Set up the UI testing infrastructure as in Task 2.2.4
   - Focus on GTK-specific testing challenges
7. Create the CI test configuration as in Task 2.2.5
8. Verify all success criteria are met
9. Proceed to Phase 3.1: Core Component Specification

## Next Steps
Once this phase is complete, proceed to [Core Component Specification](../03_component_design/01_core_components.md)
