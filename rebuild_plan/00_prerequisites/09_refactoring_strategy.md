# Refactoring Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for refactoring the Preview Maker application from its current monolithic structure to the new component-based architecture. The goal is to guide a safe, incremental migration while maintaining application functionality throughout the process.

## Core Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: Refactor gradually in small, testable chunks
2. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure the application remains functional during refactoring
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Write tests before refactoring to verify functionality
4. **Feature Parity**: Ensure no loss of features during the refactoring process
5. **Clear Architecture**: Move toward the component-based architecture defined in the design docs

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Create a detailed map of the current codebase structure
   - Identify high-level components and their implicit dependencies
   - Document entry points and control flow

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Create a test harness for existing functionality
   - Implement critical path tests to validate core functionality
   - Create snapshot tests for UI states to catch regressions

3. **Refactoring Tooling**
   - Set up linters and code quality tools
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Create refactoring checklists and guidelines

### Phase 2: Extract Core Infrastructure

   - Create PromptManager component
   - Develop improved prompt templates

4. **Response Parsing**
   - Extract response parsing logic
   - Create ResponseParser component
   - Add comprehensive tests for different response scenarios

### Phase 6: Refactor Application Core

1. **Application Lifecycle**
   - Extract application startup and shutdown
   - Create ApplicationCore component
   - Implement dependency injection framework

2. **Event System**
   - Create a consistent event system
   - Update components to use the event system
   - Reduce direct component dependencies

3. **State Management**
   - Extract application state management
   - Implement clean state transitions
   - Ensure state persistence where needed

## Refactoring Techniques

### Strangler Fig Pattern

The "Strangler Fig" pattern will be used to gradually replace parts of the monolithic application:

1. **Create New Component**: Implement the new component alongside the old code
2. **Route Usage**: Gradually route calls from the old code to the new component
3. **Migrate Functionality**: Move functionality piece by piece
4. **Remove Old Code**: Once all functionality is migrated, remove the old code

Example for ConfigurationMgr:

```python
# Step 1: Create the new component
class ConfigurationMgr:
    def __init__(self):
        # New implementation
        pass

    def load_config(self):
        # New implementation
        pass

# Step 2: Create an adapter to route between old and new
def load_configuration():
    # Check if we should use new implementation
    if USE_NEW_CONFIG_MANAGER:
        config_mgr = ConfigurationMgr()
        return config_mgr.load_config()
    else:
        # Old implementation
        return legacy_load_configuration()
```

### Feature Flags

Feature flags will be used to control the activation of new components:

1. **Define Flags**: Create a system of feature flags for each component
2. **Flag Control**: Allow runtime enabling/disabling of new components
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Incrementally enable new components as they are stabilized

Example:

```python
class FeatureFlags:
    USE_NEW_CONFIG_MANAGER = True
    USE_NEW_IMAGE_LOADER = False
    USE_NEW_AI_SERVICE = False

def get_image_loader():
    if FeatureFlags.USE_NEW_IMAGE_LOADER:
        return ImageLoader()
    else:
        return LegacyImageLoader()
```

### Dependency Injection

Implement dependency injection to manage component dependencies:

1. **Identify Dependencies**: Map out required dependencies for each component
2. **Create Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for each service
3. **Inject Dependencies**: Use constructor or setter injection
4. **Create DI Container**: Implement a simple DI container for managing instances

### Testing Strategies

1. **Characterization Tests**: Create tests that capture current behavior before refactoring
2. **Test Doubles**: Use mocks and stubs to isolate components
3. **Integration Tests**: Ensure components work together
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Verify overall application functionality

## Handling Challenges

### Circular Dependencies

1. **Identify Cycles**: Map component relationships to find cycles
2. **Break Cycles**: Use techniques like:
   - Introduce intermediary components
   - Extract shared dependencies to higher levels
   - Use events instead of direct references
   - Implement the mediator pattern

### Global State

1. **Identify Global State**: Find all global variables and singletons
2. **Encapsulate**: Move global state into proper components
3. **Inject Dependencies**: Pass state explicitly where needed
4. **Event System**: Use events to communicate state changes

### Mixed Responsibilities

1. **Single Responsibility**: Ensure each component has a single responsibility
2. **Extract Methods**: Split large methods into smaller, focused functions
3. **Extract Classes**: Move related functionality into specialized classes

## Validation and Verification

### Continuous Testing

1. **Automated Tests**: Run tests after each refactoring step
2. **Manual Verification**: Test core user scenarios manually
3. **Visual Regression**: Compare UI before and after changes

### Code Quality Metrics

1. **Complexity**: Monitor cyclomatic complexity
2. **Dependencies**: Track dependency counts and cycles
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure high test coverage for refactored code

## Rollback Strategy

1. **Version Control**: Commit after each successful refactoring step
2. **Feature Flags**: Allow disabling new components if issues are found
3. **Parallel Implementations**: Maintain old code until new code is proven

## Timeline and Prioritization

1. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize lower-risk components first
2. **Impact Analysis**: Consider impact on user experience
3. **Dependency Order**: Refactor components in dependency order (least dependent first)
4. **Critical Path**: Identify and prioritize components on the critical path

## Communication and Documentation

1. **Update Documentation**: Keep design documents updated with changes
2. **Code Comments**: Document refactoring decisions in code
3. **Migration Guides**: Create guides for other developers

## Conclusion

This refactoring strategy provides a structured approach to safely transforming the Preview Maker application. By following these guidelines, the team can incrementally migrate the codebase to the new architecture while maintaining functionality and minimizing risk.
