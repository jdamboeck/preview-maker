# Quality Assurance Strategy

This document outlines the quality assurance strategy for the Preview Maker rebuild. It provides a framework for ensuring that the rebuilt application meets quality standards, preserves existing functionality, and delivers a reliable user experience.

## Quality Assurance Goals

1. **Ensure Feature Parity**: Verify that all existing features in the current implementation are preserved in the rebuild
2. **Improve Code Quality**: Ensure the rebuilt codebase follows best practices and maintains high quality standards
3. **Enhance Reliability**: Reduce bugs and crashes compared to the current implementation
4. **Improve Performance**: Optimize performance for image processing and AI operations
5. **Ensure Compatibility**: Verify the rebuilt application works across supported platforms and environments

## Testing Approach

### Testing Levels

#### Unit Testing

- **Coverage Target**: Aim for 80% code coverage for core components
- **Testing Framework**: pytest
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Individual components and their methods
  - Isolated functionality
  - Edge cases
  - Error handling
- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - Write tests alongside component implementation
  - Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) for dependencies
  - Ensure tests are fast and deterministic

#### Integration Testing

- **Coverage Target**: Test all component interactions and integration points
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with appropriate fixtures
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Component interactions
  - Data flow between components
  - API integrations (Gemini AI)
  - File system interactions
- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - Create integration test suites for related component groups
  - Use controlled test environments
  - Test both happy paths and error scenarios

#### UI Testing

- **Coverage Target**: Test all UI workflows and interactions
- **Testing Framework**: pytest-gtk or similar GTK testing tools
- **Focus Areas**:
  - User workflows
  - UI responsiveness
  - Layout and rendering
  - Event handling
- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - Create automated UI tests for critical paths
  - Implement UI component tests
  - Test UI under different window sizes and configurations

#### End-to-End Testing

- **Coverage Target**: Test complete user workflows from start to finish
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with appropriate plugins
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Complete user scenarios
  - Data persistence
  - Performance under realistic conditions
- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - Create scripts that simulate user actions
  - Use realistic test data
  - Verify outcomes match expected results

### Testing Types

#### Functional Testing

- Verify all features work as expected
- Test normal and boundary conditions
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data

#### Performance Testing

- Measure application startup time
- Evaluate image loading and processing speed
- Assess memory usage during operations
- Test with large images and batches

#### Usability Testing

- Evaluate UI/UX for intuitiveness
- Test accessibility features
- Gather feedback from test users

#### Compatibility Testing

- Test on different Linux distributions
- Verify with different Python versions
- Test with various GTK theme configurations

#### Security Testing

- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Test file handling for security issues
- Verify proper handling of external data

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Automated Testing Pipeline

- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Configure test environments in CI/CD
- Set up test reporting and notifications

#### Test Data Management

- Create a repository of test images
- Develop data generation tools for edge cases
- Document test data organization and usage

#### Test Environments

- Configure consistent development test environments
- Document environment setup procedures
- Create containerized test environments for isolation

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like flake8, pylint, and mypy
- **Code Complexity**: Monitor cyclomatic complexity and maintain below threshold
- **Code Style**: Enforce PEP 8 compliance
- **Documentation**: Ensure all components have proper docstrings and documentation

### Test Quality Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Track and report code coverage
- **Test Reliability**: Monitor flaky tests and fix immediately
- **Test Performance**: Keep test suite execution time reasonable

### Bug Metrics

- **Bug Density**: Track bugs per component
- **Bug Severity Distribution**: Monitor distribution of bug severity
- **Time to Fix**: Track average time to fix bugs
- **Regression Rate**: Monitor rate of regression bugs

## Quality Assurance Process

### During Development

1. Developers write unit tests alongside implementation
2. Code reviews include review of tests
3. All code must pass static analysis before merge
4. New features require test coverage
5. Bug fixes include regression tests

### Pre-Release

1. Run complete test suite (unit, integration, UI, end-to-end)
2. Perform manual testing of key workflows
3. Conduct performance and compatibility testing
4. Review test coverage and quality metrics
5. Document known issues and limitations

### Post-Release

1. Monitor application telemetry for issues
2. Address critical bugs immediately
3. Collect user feedback
4. Plan improvements for future releases

## Regression Testing Strategy

### Feature Comparison Testing

- Create a feature parity checklist from existing application
- Test each feature in the rebuild against original implementation
- Document any intentional differences

### Visual Regression Testing

- Capture screenshots of key UI states in original application
- Compare with rebuilt application to identify visual differences
- Use automated tools for pixel-by-pixel comparison where possible

### Data Compatibility Testing

- Test that the rebuild can read data created by original implementation
- Verify that outputs are compatible with existing workflows
- Test migration paths for user configurations

## AI Component Testing

### Prompt Testing

- Test prompt templates with various inputs
- Verify prompt engineering effectiveness
- Test prompt variations for performance

### AI Integration Testing

- Test integration with Gemini AI API
- Verify error handling for API failures
- Test fallback mechanisms

### AI Output Validation

- Verify parsing of AI responses
- Test handling of unexpected AI outputs
- Measure accuracy of AI-generated results

## Documentation for Testing

### Test Plan

- Develop comprehensive test plan document
- Define test scope and objectives
- Specify test resources and schedule

### Test Cases

- Document test cases for all testing levels
- Include test data requirements
- Specify expected results

### Test Reports
