# Risk Management Plan

This document outlines the risk management strategy for the Preview Maker rebuild project. It identifies potential risks, provides assessment, mitigation strategies, and establishes a framework for ongoing risk monitoring and management throughout the rebuild process.

## Risk Management Process

1. **Risk Identification**: Continuously identify potential risks throughout the project
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the probability and impact of each risk
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Develop strategies to reduce probability or impact
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Track identified risks and detect new ones
5. **Risk Response**: Implement mitigation strategies when risks materialize

## High Priority Risks

The following risks require immediate attention and proactive mitigation:

### T1: Circular Dependencies

**Risk**: The component-based architecture may introduce circular dependencies that complicate the codebase.

**Impact**: Circular dependencies can lead to tight coupling, making the code hard to maintain, test, and extend.

**Mitigation**:
1. Regularly review component dependency diagrams
2. Use dependency injection to manage component relationships
3. Implement event systems for loose coupling
4. Apply mediator pattern where appropriate
5. Create architectural review checklist to detect cycles

### T3: GTK 4.0 API Compatibility Issues

**Risk**: The project relies on GTK 4.0, which has significant differences from GTK 3.

**Impact**: These differences could lead to incorrect implementations, bugs, or performance issues.

**Mitigation**:
1. Create comprehensive GTK 4.0 development guide
2. Implement abstraction layers for GTK-specific functionality
3. Set up GTK-specific test cases
4. Consult with GTK experts on best practices
5. Create sample implementations for common patterns

### PM1: Scope Creep

**Risk**: The rebuild might attempt to add too many new features or improvements at once.

**Impact**: This could extend the timeline, increase complexity, and risk the overall success of the project.

**Mitigation**:
1. Define clear rebuild objectives and scope boundaries
2. Create a feature prioritization framework
3. Implement change control process for new requests
4. Break the rebuild into well-defined phases
5. Track scope changes and communicate impact

### U3: Feature Regression

**Risk**: Existing features may be lost or broken during the rebuild.

**Impact**: Users would lose functionality they depend on, leading to dissatisfaction.

**Mitigation**:
1. Document all existing features in detail
2. Create a feature parity checklist for testing
3. Implement characterization tests for existing features
4. Use feature flags to compare old and new implementations
5. Conduct thorough regression testing before release

## Risk Monitoring

### Key Risk Indicators

1. **Code Quality Metrics**:
   - Cyclomatic complexity
   - Code coverage
   - Static analysis warnings
   - Build and test failures

2. **Project Metrics**:
   - Velocity (stories/tasks completed per iteration)
   - Technical debt accumulation
   - Bug count and severity
   - Feature completion percentage

3. **User Experience Metrics**:
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Usability testing results
   - Feature parity percentage

### Risk Review Process

1. **Weekly Risk Review Meeting**:
   - Review status of tracked risks
   - Identify new risks
   - Update risk assessments
   - Adjust mitigation strategies

2. **Risk Dashboard**:
   - Maintain visual representation of current risk status
   - Track risk trends over time
   - Highlight escalating risks

3. **Risk Documentation**:

   - Update risk status and mitigation progress
   - Document lessons learned from realized risks

## Contingency Plans

### Technical Issues

1. **Architecture Contingency**:
   - Maintain ability to revert to previous architectural patterns
   - Implement feature flags to enable/disable new components
   - Document fallback approaches for major architectural changes

2. **Performance Contingency**:
   - Establish performance budgets for critical operations
   - Create performance optimization backlog
   - Prepare to prioritize performance issues if they emerge

### Project Management Issues

1. **Scope Contingency**:
   - Identify core vs. nice-to-have features
   - Prepare phased release plan to defer non-critical features
   - Maintain minimal viable product definition

2. **Timeline Contingency**:
   - Identify schedule buffers for high-risk components
   - Prepare alternative implementation approaches for complex features
   - Document acceptable simplifications if needed

### External Dependency Issues

1. **API Contingency**:
   - Implement caching for external API calls
   - Create fallback mechanisms for API failures
   - Prepare local alternatives for critical external services

## Risk Response Protocols

### High Impact Risk Response

When a high impact risk materializes:

1. **Immediate Assessment**:
   - Evaluate the current impact
   - Determine spread to other components
   - Assess options for containment

2. **Response Team Formation**:
   - Assemble team with relevant expertise
   - Assign clear responsibilities
   - Establish communication channels

3. **Action Plan Development**:
   - Develop short-term mitigation
   - Create longer-term resolution plan
   - Identify required resources

4. **Implementation and Monitoring**:
   - Execute mitigation actions
   - Monitor effectiveness
   - Adjust approach as needed

5. **Documentation and Learning**:
   - Document the issue and resolution
   - Update risk management plan
   - Share lessons learned

### Medium/Low Impact Risk Response

For medium or low impact risks:

1. **Document in Issue Tracking**:
   - Create detailed issue description
   - Assign priority based on impact
   - Link to relevant components

2. **Schedule Resolution**:
   - Assign to appropriate sprint/milestone
   - Allocate necessary resources
   - Set timeline for resolution

3. **Implement and Verify**:
   - Resolve according to standard procedures
   - Verify resolution through testing
   - Document in risk register

## Conclusion

This risk management plan provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks throughout the Preview Maker rebuild project. By proactively managing risks, the project team can minimize disruptions, maintain focus on core objectives, and increase the likelihood of a successful rebuild.

The plan should be treated as a living document, updated regularly as the project progresses and new risks are identified or existing risks change in probability or impact.
