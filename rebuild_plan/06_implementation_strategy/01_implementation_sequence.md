# Phase 6.1: Create Incremental Implementation Plan

## Overview
This phase defines a clear sequence for implementing components that ensures the application remains in a testable state throughout the rebuild process. The plan establishes dependencies between components, defines milestone markers, and creates a roadmap for the actual implementation phase.

## Goals
- Define the sequence for implementing components
- Create dependency graph for implementation order
- Set up milestone markers for testing
- Create transition strategy from old to new codebase

## Tasks

### Task 6.1.1: Create Component Dependency Graph
- [ ] Analyze component dependencies
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/dependency_graph.md
  ```
- [ ] Create visual dependency diagram
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/dependency_diagram.svg
  ```
- [ ] Document circular dependencies and resolution strategies
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/circular_dependencies.md
  ```
- [ ] Define implementation order based on dependencies
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/implementation_order.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Clear documentation of component dependencies and implementation order

### Task 6.1.2: Define Implementation Milestones
- [ ] Define Core Functionality milestone
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/milestones/01_core_functionality.md
  ```
- [ ] Create Basic UI milestone
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/milestones/02_basic_ui.md
  ```
- [ ] Establish Enhanced Features milestone
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/milestones/03_enhanced_features.md
  ```
- [ ] Define Refinement milestone
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/milestones/04_refinement.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Clear milestone definitions with component lists and success criteria

### Task 6.1.3: Create Implementation Task Breakdown
- [ ] Break down Core Functionality implementation tasks
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/tasks/core_tasks.md
  ```
- [ ] Define UI implementation tasks
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/tasks/ui_tasks.md
  ```
- [ ] Create Enhanced Features implementation tasks
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/tasks/enhanced_tasks.md
  ```
- [ ] Define Refinement implementation tasks
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/tasks/refinement_tasks.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Detailed task breakdown for each component with clear acceptance criteria

### Task 6.1.4: Create Testing Strategy
- [ ] Define testing approach for each milestone
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/testing/milestone_testing.md
  ```
- [ ] Create test coverage requirements
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/testing/coverage_requirements.md
  ```
- [ ] Define acceptance test criteria
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/testing/acceptance_criteria.md
  ```
- [ ] Create regression testing strategy
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/testing/regression_strategy.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive testing strategy aligned with implementation milestones

### Task 6.1.5: Create Transition Plan
- [ ] Define strategy for migrating from old to new codebase
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/transition/migration_strategy.md
  ```
- [ ] Create feature parity checklist
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/transition/feature_parity.md
  ```
- [ ] Define data migration approach (if needed)
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/transition/data_migration.md
  ```
- [ ] Create user transition guide
  ```bash
  touch docs/implementation/transition/user_guide.md
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Clear plan for transitioning from the old codebase to the new implementation

## AI Entry Point
When entering at this step, you should:

1. First review all component specifications from Phase 3
2. Analyze component dependencies to create the dependency graph (Task 6.1.1)
   - Identify which components depend on others
   - Create a visual representation of dependencies
   - Define a logical implementation order
3. Define implementation milestones (Task 6.1.2)
   - Group components into logical milestones
   - Define clear success criteria for each milestone
   - Ensure each milestone results in a testable state
4. Create the implementation task breakdown (Task 6.1.3)
   - Break down each component into specific tasks
   - Define acceptance criteria for each task
   - Estimate relative complexity
5. Develop the testing strategy (Task 6.1.4)
   - Define how each milestone will be tested
   - Specify test coverage requirements
   - Create acceptance test criteria
6. Create the transition plan (Task 6.1.5)
   - Define how to migrate from old to new codebase
   - Create feature parity validation approach
   - Plan for user transition
7. Verify all success criteria are met
8. Proceed to Phase 6.2: Bridge Strategy for Maintaining Functionality
