# Implementation Starting Point

This document provides a concrete starting point for implementing the Preview Maker rebuild. It helps developers know exactly where to begin and the first steps to take.

## First Steps

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/jdamboeck/preview-maker.git
   cd preview-maker

   # Build the Docker environment
   docker-compose -f rebuild_plan/docker/docker-compose.yml build

   # Verify the environment
   docker-compose -f rebuild_plan/docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm verify
   ```

2. **Familiarize with Core Components**:
   - Read the component dependency diagram: `00_prerequisites/08_component_dependency_diagram.md`
   - Understand the existing code mapping: `00_prerequisites/02_existing_code_mapping.md`
   - Review the GTK 4.0 test implementation: `gtk_overlay_test.py`

3. **First Component to Implement**: Image Processor
   - Begin with the core image processing functionality
   - This component has minimal dependencies on other components
   - It provides a foundation for other components to build upon

## Implementation Sequence

Follow this implementation sequence to ensure components with dependencies are built after their prerequisites:

1. **Core Infrastructure**:
   - Configuration Management
   - Logging System
   - Error Handling Framework

2. **Image Processing**:
   - Image Loading and Caching
   - Circular Mask Generation
   - Image Transformation Utilities

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Gemini API Client
   - Response Parsing
   - Fallback Detection Mechanisms

4. **UI Components**:
   - Main Application Window
   - Image Display Widget
   - Overlay Management
   - User Controls

5. **Integration Layer**:
   - Event Communication System
   - Component Coordination

## Key Files to Create First

│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py          # Configuration management
│   └── logging.py         # Logging setup
├── image/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── processor.py       # Image processing functionality

│   └── conftest.py        # Pytest configuration
└── app.py                 # Application entry point
```

## Initial Tasks

1. Create the basic directory structure as outlined above
2. Implement the configuration management system
3. Set up the logging infrastructure
4. Create the core image processor component
5. Write tests for each component as it's developed

## Dependency Management

Start by creating a `requirements.txt` file in the project root with the following dependencies:

```
pillow>=9.0.0
pygobject>=3.42.0
google-generativeai>=0.3.0
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
toml>=0.10.2
pydantic>=2.0.0
loguru>=0.7.0
```

## Integration with Existing Code

When implementing each component:
1. Check the existing code mapping to understand current implementation
2. Create adapters where needed to maintain compatibility
3. Write tests that verify both standalone functionality and integration

Follow the "Working with Old Directory Structure" section in the `.cursorrules` file for guidance on managing the transition.

## Progress Tracking

Create a progress tracking document in the project root:

```markdown
